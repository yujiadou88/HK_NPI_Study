# Hong Kong NPI study

## 1. Study overview

There is a serious deficit in the evidence base on whether non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce the spread of influenza. We implemented a study of whether face masks and hand hygiene can reduce influenza transmission among Hong Kong household members.

In 2007 (pilot) and 2008 (main study) we recruited subjects presenting to outpatient clinics (in both the private and public sectors across Hong Kong) with influenza-like-illness of \<48 hours duration. After influenza was confirmed in an index case by the QuickVue Influenza A+B rapid test, or in some clinics based on a clinical definition alone, the household of the index subject was randomized to 1) control or 2) hand hygiene or 3) hand hygiene plus surgical face masks (the 3rd arm was surgical face masks in the pilot study). We aimed to implement the interventions at an initial home visit within 36 hours of recruitment, and evaluate subsequent infections by self-reported daily symptom diaries and home visits after 3 and 6 days (and additionally after 9 days in the pilot study). Nose and throat swabs were collected from index subjects and all household contacts at each home visit and tested by viral culture and or RT-PCR. The primary outcome measure was laboratory-confirmed influenza infection in a household contact by viral culture (pilot) or RT-PCR (main); the secondary outcome was clinically diagnosed influenza by self-reported symptoms. We evaluated adherence by self-report and by measuring the number of surgical masks used and weighing the amount of soap/hand rub used.

Full details of our study design are available in our [study protocol](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002101) (the link is to version GML001.5, 10-Dec-2007).

We are often asked why we chose to recruit index cases presenting with ILI and observe their households for a week (called a 'case-ascertained' design), rather than starting with a cohort of uninfected households and following them over an influenza season. Much greater resources might be required for the latter study, given the low annual attack rate of influenza.

A weakness of our chosen study design is the delay between index case symptom onset (or more precisely the onset of index case infectiousness) and application of the intervention, and any intervention effects we observe would likely be attenuated due to this delay. We are actively working on models which can estimate intervention effects allowing for delays. Key changes made:
